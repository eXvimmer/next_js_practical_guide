JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, world.\n";
  return 0;
}

```
